| Welcome to SpacePig! The next big game! Here is how to play:   |
|                                                                |
| + run SpacePig.exe in this folder                              |
|                                                                |
| + hit "r" to start the game, or to reset if you die            |
| + use the arrow keys to move the pig and dodge projectiles     |
| + hit "e" to enable mouse movement, and play that way          |
| + hit "x" to close the window and end the game                 |

Possible future improvements:
 + More intelligence on bullet projection (i.e, patterns per wave, symmetric waves vs random direction/speed for each shot)
 + Local and online scoreboard integration
 + Haven't touched this in awhile, but iirc there could be some cleaning up in main.cpp
